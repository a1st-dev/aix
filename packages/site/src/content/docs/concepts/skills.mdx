title: Skills, Rules, and Prompts
description: Understanding the different types of AI configuration.
---

aix supports three types of AI instructions: skills, rules, and prompts.

## Skills

Skills are detailed instructions that teach the AI how to perform specific tasks. They're typically longer and more comprehensive than rules.

**Use skills for:**
- Coding standards and patterns
- Review checklists
- Complex workflows
- Domain-specific knowledge

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "react-patterns",
      "source": "https://example.com/react-patterns.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules

Rules are concise constraints or guidelines. They're typically short and focused on a single behavior.

**Use rules for:**
- Code style preferences
- Security requirements
- Forbidden patterns
- Quick reminders

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "no-any",
      "content": "Never use the 'any' type in TypeScript"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates for common interactions. They can include placeholders for dynamic content.

**Use prompts for:**
- Code explanation templates
- Review request formats
- Documentation generation
- Refactoring instructions

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "explain",
      "content": "Explain this code to a junior developer: {{code}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sources

Skills, rules, and prompts can be loaded from:

- **URLs**: GitHub raw files, gists, any public URL
- **npm packages**: Published configuration packages
- **Local files**: Relative paths in your project
- **Inline content**: Direct text in the configuration
