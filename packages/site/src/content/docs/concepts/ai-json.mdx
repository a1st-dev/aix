The `ai.json` file is the central configuration for aix. It defines your AI agent's skills, rules, prompts, and MCP servers in a single, portable format.

## Structure

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://aix.a1st.dev/schema.json",
  "skills": [],
  "rules": [],
  "prompts": [],
  "mcpServers": {},
  "extends": []
}
```

## Sections

    }
  ]
}
```

### rules

```json

    }
  ]
}
```

### prompts

```json
{
  "prompts": [

      "content": "Explain this code in simple terms: {{code}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### mcpServers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {

      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```
